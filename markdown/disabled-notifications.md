## Introduction
After recently reading **Deep Work** by Cal Newtch I started to think about all the things that are stealing my attention and not allowing my brain to fully immerse myself in whatever I'm doing. In a world with constant distractions surrounding you it's sometimes very hard to find any sort of attention or focus.

I tend to think of myself as having it fairly easy to reach a state of flow. Being a remote working developer with a small child living in the same appartment, I had to learn to cancel out all the surrounding noise, it's do or die, right? 

However one thing that I didn't really reflect upon previously is how much power notifications on my phone hold over me. Wherever I am, my phone goes. If I leave my desk to go to the kitchen, my phone goes with me. If I leave to go to the bathroom, the phone goes to. Also sadly and to my big embarrasement, even while I'm with my daughter I have a tendancy to habitually pick up the phone, maybe something interesting happend right? right?
All for that quick hit of dopamine, nice...

## Todays World

AI is more accessible today than ever before, the big corporations are spending billions competing for your attention, and they're damn good at suceeding to. How many times have you not been actively working on something, just to pick up the phone and all of a sudden you've lost your state of flow and have spent way to much time browsing or ended up in a rabbit hole in something totally unrelated to what you were doing? Been there, done that

The AI systems that is being applied by the big corporations are getting better, and at an growing rate. Both our willpower, attention and time in life is a finite resource. **So what can we do**?

By disabling notifications you're still able to browse whatever you want whenever you want. However your phone won't be spammed by notifications, custom fitted to grab your attention. All those billions spent, wasted! While you on the other hand don't have to waste any willpower or attention at all to fight it of. You're time is now yours to do with as you please. 

## Conclusion

I disabled **all** notifications on my phone. All those previous distractions which many times stole my focus without me even realising it, gone! My ability to focus is improved, I'm more engaged while spending time with my daughter and I rarely found myself suddenly realizing i'm reading some random article trying to figure out wth happend and how I got here. Guess how many important stories or news that I actually missed? 0    

Now I read when **I decide** it's time to take a break and see what's been going on in the world, and not the other way around.


Reclaim your attention, disable notifications.
